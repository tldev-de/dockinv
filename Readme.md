# dock[er]inv[entory]

## Description
This project helps to get an overview of used docker images across multiple servers. It consists of two parts: dockinv agent and dockinv server. The agent is a simple python script that gives limited external access to the containers endpoint of the docker api. The server is a web application that collects the information and displays it in a web interface.
